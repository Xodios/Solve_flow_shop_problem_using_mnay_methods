So in branch and bound,
I was kinda off during that month
So I was thinking about it and I came up with this:
What if each time we makea  branch 
the minmu thingy is the sum of all the rest
if the sum is bigger than what we are looking for than we don't take
at first we will have a lot of solution but they will get lower by time 
I think we can even optimize it
like stroe some data that will be used or something 
like adding up each pair until we have the sum of the pairs....
I guess the 10 first will detrmine the solution like the 20!/10!
